# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

Hello! This repository includes the needed files for the course project, including run_analysis.R, the main piece of code that cleans up the original dataset.

**Files**
1. **tidy_data.txt** - Final tidied dataset
- It downloads and unzips the file
- This merges the data from testing and training
- It also adds and renames column names to make the dataset more understandable
- It then filters the dataset to collect the mean and standard deviation values
- This finally creates the second tidy dataset
2. **CodeBook.md** - List of variables and data with descriptions
3. **run_analysis.R** - Script for tidying datasets
